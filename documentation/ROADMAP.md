# Future Coniderations and Roadmap
Outlines features, enhancements, and improvements that may be implemented in future iterations of the application. These are not part of the current release but have been identified as important measures for scalability and security.

## Authentication and Authorization
- Implement refresh tokens for longer sessions without comprimising security with the time limit.
- Add role-based access for specific permissions.
- Enable multi-factor authentication for critical operations such as withdrawals and transfers.

## Data Protection
- Maintain an audit trail of transactions to debug failed login attempts or suspicious activity.

## Development and User Experience
- Containerize the application with Docker for auditing and reproducibility.
- Create a simple frontend interface.
- Test the client application demonstrating the flow.
